{"Post time": "2017-06-14  5:23pm", "Description": "\n        \nHouse: Outer Richmond house a couple blocks from Ocean Beach, Golden Gate Park, and Safeway. House has two bedrooms, one shared bathroom, kitchen, living room, dining room and backyard. The room for rent is about 13' by 12', with a closet, and enough room for a queen bed, desk, chair, and some additional furniture. The bedrooms are on opposite sides of the house, with the room for rent on the street side of the house, and the other room in the back of the house, so there is separation between the bedrooms. There is a washer/dryer and also another toilet/sink in the garage. The area is quiet for SF, street parking is relatively easy, traffic is light, and buses do not go down this street. \n\nMe: 37, gay, male. Right now, I'm a full-time student through December 2017. My work background is in administrative healthcare and my old hobbies include skateboarding and playing/listening to music. I drink beer at night, and at the end of the day I am pretty much always having some beers while quietly listening to music or watching TV. You'll never have a problem with me because of drinking, but this is my way of relaxing at night, and the quantity can be impressive. I'm friendly and I'm considerate, but I'm also used to doing my own thing, and I'm not looking to hang with roommates all the time. My previous roommates lived here for 2 \u00bd years and 4 years respectively.\n\nCats: I have two cats. One sleeps inside all day, and the other is a *#@%^(#% who is often outside. It's tricky to imagine how another cat will fit in, but if you think you can make it work, we can talk about it.\n\nDogs: A small dog (under 20lbs) should be fine, and bigger dogs might be ok, but you will have to bring the dog over so I know that it is ok with cats. If your dog barks in the house or barks at me, I expect you to quiet it. I don't want to raise another puppy in my house, but if it's going to be a small dog (under 20lbs) then it might be ok. In general, I expect you to be highly responsible for your dog and its behavior.\n\nSummary: I'd like to find a clean, quiet, responsible person, looking for a mellow living situation, where we can both count on coming home to a peaceful environment. The house has to be quiet and sleep-able by around midnight. Having friends over sometimes is fine, but less often than every weekend, and you don't bring groups of people back here to hang out after the bar closes. Alcohol/420 done responsibly is no problem however, done irresponsibly will be a problem, and I'm not looking to have parties here. I don't smoke weed or cigarettes, and I would prefer a non-cigarette smoker. If you do smoke cigarettes, you MUST smoke them outside, and I am completely NOT flexible about this in ANY way. Shared utilities are Comcast Wifi, PG & E, and SF PUC (water), and currently range from $120 - $150 total each depending on usage. Using the heat does cost more in the winter. Room is available July 1st, and rent can be pro-rated for weeks in June/July if necessary.  Month to month rental, $1,250 move-in deposit/$1,250 monthly rent plus utilities, so $2500 due to move in.

If you'd prefer unfurnished, let's talk. It may be possible. Large window faces south so it gets great light and full sun. Rent is $1350/month + $500 security deposit. \n\nThe apartment is a 2-bedroom with a spacious living room/dining room and good sized kitchen. I've lived here for over a year and so things are pretty well stocked in terms of furniture and kitchen. Some of the perks: big woven carpet, surround sound audio, record player, hand-turned coffee grinder that makes all the hipsters jealous, skylights in kitchen and bathroom, and lots of plants. \n\nIt's 2 blocks from Golden Gate Park, 5 blocks from Geary and the Clement Street corridor and 6 blocks from Haight-Ashbury. There's a local grocery around the corner and Trader Joe's, Safeway, and Whole Foods all nearby. There are several local coffee shops in the neighborhood and lots of food options. USF is right up the hill and UCSF is directly across the park. \n\n4 bus lines run downtown from here, including the 5 Fulton which runs a standard and/or Rapid service.

I enjoy hoppy beer, strong coffee, green plants, funky music, mountains, creeks, rivers, and good people. I cook, and I'm clean but not OCD. I work for a small nonprofit working on peace and justice issues in the Middle East (yeah, it keeps me busy). I also travel regularly. \n\nABOUT YOU: \nI'm looking for someone that is tidy (does dishes and vacuums every once in awhile), conscious (woke), and communicative (be a human being, please). This is a place where you can feel comfortable to be yourself. \n\nIf it sounds good to you, send me a message. I'm hoping to meet people very soon and hopefully get this wrapped up well before the end of the month!

I enjoy cooking, going out for dinner, and being outdoors as much as possible with the pup. It would be great if I can find someone who wants to go out out occasionally or have a glass of wine but is also happy to co-exist independently. \n\nMy dog:\nYour third roommate will be my 10 year old Boston Terrier, who is extremely mellow and easy going. He has free rein in the common areas (couches, kitchen, etc.), but of course your room will be off-limits. Unfortunately, there are no other pets allowed.\n\nAbout the apartment:\n\u2022\tLocated at the top of Nob Hill, with easy access to the 1 and 27 buses, as well as Trader Joe's and Whole Foods\n\u2022\tOur unit is a corner unit in the back of the building, and does not share any walls with other units\n\u2022\tLarge kitchen with granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and ample shelving\n\u2022\tFurnished living room, I'm still rounding out some minor pieces to replace what my roommate is taking with her, though the main pieces are here (tv, couch, armchairs)\n\u2022\tSmall patio off the kitchen\n\u2022\tShared bathroom with marble tiling and a clawfoot tub/shower\n\u2022\tLaundry in the building\n\nYour room:\nThe dark blue dresser and bed shown in the pictures will be staying in the room for your use, the pictures will be packed up and the holes patched. If you have additional furniture you would like to bring with you, that can certainly be discussed. Your room is a corner unit, with windows on two sides of the room, and a beautiful view of the hillside from one. \n\nIf this sounds like a good fit for you, please respond with a bit about yourself, including:\n\u2022\tOccupation\n\u2022\tIdeal cleaning routine\n\u2022\tWhat your typical week looks like (weekday and weekend) - work, social activities\n\u2022\tHobbies\n\u2022\tContact information including cell phone #\n\nMove-in costs will be first months' rent and $1,355 security deposit (which cannot be applied to last months' rent). Utilities flat fee of $120/month includes cleaners once a month as well as fast internet. I look forward to chatting with you.

The room comes with a large adjacent hall closet as well as some storage in the garage.  The flat is a three bedroom and 1 bath unit and it shares a sunny backyard on the first floor of a two unit house.  \n\nParking available in the garage is available for an extra $100 per month.  \n\nDishwasher in the kitchen and washer/dryer in the apartment.  \n\nWe are seeking a July 1st move in. \n\nThe apartment is approximately a 6 minute walk from the J Muni stop on Church Street, a 10 minute walk to 24th St. BART, and a two block walk to the 14 and 49 Muni bus lines on Mission Street.  While not quite as convenient, the 24 Muni bus route is also accessible. Downtown is easily reached within half an hour. \n\nThere is a corner market about a block away, a Walgreens about two blocks away and a Safeway about a 10 minute walk away.  Various other shops and restaurants are in the neighborhood along Church, Mission, and Noe Streets.  \n\nPer month rent (including Utilities, Internet, and a once a month cleaning service) is: $1450.  As noted before, off street parking in the garage is available for an additional $100 per month. To move in, we would need a total of $3625 (first month's rent plus 1.5x monthly rent as security deposit $1450+2175=$3625). We also ask for two references (personal or previous landlord is fine). Our landlord requires proof of employment and a credit report. You will be asked to sign a Sublease with us acting as Master Tenants. \n\nAbout your potential housemates: You would share the flat with two others.  Both are gay men in their 40s.  Both of our work schedules are typically M-F from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with one having every other Monday off.

We both have independent lives and interests outside of our day jobs and home but occasionally have a beer or a meal together. Occasional guests and small gatherings of friends are fine, however, we keep the house as a refuge from the daily grind and expect a non-party atmosphere.   \n\nAbout you:\n\u2022\tStable with a job outside the home\n\u2022\tNon-smoking preferred.

There is a shared courtyard in the back and hardwood floors through out the apartment. \nYour new room faces the street and has a bay window that gets tons of light, but is situated above the trees so privacy is not a problem.

She moved into this apartment 5 years ago and loves the neighborhood. Her hobbies are nail art, thrift shopping, DIY projects, wine tasting, karaoke, and dancing like nobody watching. S is always down explore the city, or hang out in the park on a sunny afternoon drinking some beers, or watch a TV show like New Girl, Project Runway, Game of Thrones, or old Friends episodes. \nJ is nearly 30 and works as an engineer at a tech company. He moved here from Toronto last summer but he's fully embracing the SF lifestyle. He's obsessed with Yosemite and all the natural beauty the California has to offer, but he also loves to kick-it indoors playing a video game. He's incredibly funny and charming and he was even in an improv group back in Canada. \n\nHere's what we expect from you, our future roommate:\nWe want someone we can get along with, watch TV with us, have group dinner parties, and can bring their own personality into our home! Of course you need to be a tidy and upstanding member of society, and have a regular 9-5 job so you can afford to live here.

They have a skittish 3-legged fluffy cat who will often explore down at your end of the hall; if you are allergic to fluffy cats this is not the place for you. The roommate you'll be sharing the front half of the apartment with is a freelance filmmaker. Age range is 25-37.  \n\nAbout you: You are a MALE (sorry ladies), have NO PETS (sorry, but our kitty would freak), and are in a similar age range. You are respectful, chill, gainfully employed, and are out and about more than you are home. You are also someone who doesn't care for cooking and doesn't use the kitchen all that often (that's the way it is now and that's how we'd like it to stay). If this doesn't sound like you, you probably aren't a good fit!\n\nAbout the flat: We share the third (top) floor of the house. We have a big backyard with a fire pit that we share with the two other flats in the building. Our apartment is then split into two parts separated by a long 60' hallway. Each end of the hall has 2 bedrooms and a full bath, and we share the kitchen and laundry room. A couple shares the back end of the house, and the front end you'll be on has a room opening up.\n\nAbout your room: Very spacious (12' by 18'), nice big windows (facing Fell St), and a mid-sized closet with some storage shelves. You will share a mid-sized living room and a bathroom with one male roommate on your side of the house.\nIf you're interested please shoot us an email with a little bit about yourself--who you are & what you're all about. If you seem like a good fit we'll schedule a room showing.\n\nRoom is $1175/month plus utilities  (WiFi, PG&E, plus house shared cleaning supplies) which ranges from $75-100 a month.  Security deposit is $1175. Move in date is July 1st.\n\nHappy house hunting!\n    ", "Title": "Come be the 4th roommate in our spacious Edwardian flat!", "URL": "https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/roo/6176625102.html", "Compensation": null, "Updated post time": null, "Post Id": "6176625102", "Address": "alamo square / nopa"},

The room is quiet and cozy; off-street at the back of the unit with a window overlooking the garden area and Mt. Sutro. A full bath is shared with other roommate, and there is also a large living room with a fireplace! Our unit comprises the entirety of the top floor of a three-unit building on a residential block. Back yard access, and coin-operated laundry in the garage. Parking in a driveway spot is negotiable for a compact car. Conveniently located within a 5-minute walk to Golden Gate Park, a 15-minute walk to UCSF, and half a block from the N Judah Muni line. It's pretty nice.\n\nUS: The two of us roommates are working professionals in our early 30's (a male and a female), and we both work primarily from home and travel for work occasionally. There are also two furry roommates roaming the premises: 9-year old cat brothers! One of which is the most chill, friendly, dog-like cat you've ever met. His brother on the other-hand, is slightly more of a cat... There is a young family with two young children that live downstairs. \n\nYOU: Working professional (male or female, doesn't matter to us) or at least adult enough to have your shit together- respectful, tidy, and not allergic to cats (because that would just suck for you). You do not work from home, because we both work from home, and I think that we would probably go completely nuts if three of us worked from home. Single occupancy is ideal. No smoking of any kind in the building, but outside is fine.\n\nMONIES: $1000 refundable security deposit and $1,500 a month, for a total of $2,500 to move-in.

Need to find the right person ASAP.\n\nFeels like a French country cottage -- serene, sunny and charming.  It's on a separate wing of the apt. building -- an enclave unto itself.  \n\nNo traffic sounds -- only birds -- yet as soon as you leave the bldg, you're amidst all the pizzazz of one of SF's premier neighborhoods. \n\nSPECTACULAR panoramic views of the waterfront -- both from the large redwood rooftop terrace and from the deck overlooking a garden.  \n\nThe waterfront views are more commanding and beautiful than many million dollar condos.\n\nLooking for: male or female who is mature & considerate, quiet lifestyle and has STEADY DAYTIME FULL-TIME WORK outside the apt, as I work at home during the day, as a freelance writer and editor.\n\nNo smokers please. No drugs. No pets. No couples. \n\n\u25ba  PLEASE see questions at end of this ad -- answers requested before meeting as it gives me an idea about whether this would be a good fit.  PLEASE put your answers directly below each question!  If you have a LinkedIn link, kindly attach. \n\n\u25ba  PLEASE NOTE:  This apt. is probably not the best fit for someone who does a lot of serious steady cooking because it's a small kitchen and I love to cook.  Light cooking OK.\n\n\u25ba  SUMMARY:  \n\nOne bedroom in CHARMING 2-bedroom apt. in the heart of one of SF's most desirable neighborhoods.  It's SO quiet yet it's just steps from all the neighborhood excitement (loaded with international restaurants, caf\u00e9s, clubs, gyms, etc.) and the sublime waterfront.  The apt is a 7 min walk to Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach and Chinatown.  An amazing location!\n\nPANORAMIC vistas of the Golden Gate Bridge, the bay, the Marina, the long sweep of the Presidio and the Marin Headlands -- from large rooftop (redwood) terrace. A deck off the living room overlooks private garden and the GG Bridge.   Sunsets are \"to die for!    \n\nALL utilities included. At home, you'd hear no traffic -- only birds and the alluring sound of foghorns. It's a true sanctuary after a busy work day.  On Vallejo (at Polk), it's steps from Starbucks (at Polk & Vallejo), Peets Coffee, Crunch Fitness, Real Foods and much more. This is the BEST corner in Russian Hill, and the price is right!\n\nThe apt. is also very close to all the cultural attractions at Fort Mason with its ongoing festivals, farmer's markets, craft shows, theater performances, food truck soir\u00e9es every Friday & more (every weekend). Plus, it's about a 7-min bus ride to Civic Center (the Opera House, Davies Symphony Hall, Herbst Theater). \n\nNOTE:  The available room comfortably holds a large bed, bedside table, large dresser, desk & chair.  It overlooks the garden & part of Russian Hill. It's sunny and cheerful.  Freshly painted.  Hardwood floors. A large dresser must stay.  Plus a desk, if you want it.  \n================================================\n\nI will be showing it in the coming days, at your convenience, but preferably during the daytime to show off the light, garden, rooftop deck & rooftop terrace. \n\n$1350/month (includes ALL utilities plus Wi-Fi), plus the normal damage deposit.\n=================================================\n\n\u25cf A GARDEN wraps around the apt. on 3 sides (roses, lilies, walnut tree, jade plant, etc.)\n\u25cf SUNNY, SERENE, & VERY SAFE. \n\u25cf Apt. is handsomely furnished. \n\u25cf Available bedroom has a large dresser, desk and chair.  \n\u25cf It's on a separate wing of the building, an enclave unto itself. \n\u25cf Extremely QUIET. No traffic noise.\n\u25cf Just a few minutes' walk to Fisherman's Wharf\n\u25cf Neighborhood is EXCITING (full of international restaurants, cafes, interesting shops)\n\u25cf Just STEPS from many bus lines (on Van Ness, Polk, Union St., etc.)\n\n\u25ba  ALSO note:   This apt. would probably NOT work if you have a lot of furniture you want to move in as the place is fully furnished. \n======================================================\n\nMy interests are film, theater, music, reading, cultural exchanges, travel, hiking, cooking, photography and environmental issues.  I have a quiet lifestyle.  Ivy League grad (Columbia University, N.Y.C.).  I am a travel writer, currently working on two books and a screenplay.  As a journalist, my cover and feature articles have appeared in the Los Angeles Times and the SF Chronicle.  \n\nMy hope is to find someone who can commit for at least one year.

{"Post time": "2017-06-26  5:34pm", "Description": "\n        \nI'm looking for an upbeat, thoughtful roomie to share my spacious Inner Richmond flat with me and my friendly cockatiel. While I'm very independent and need my time alone, I'm seeking to build a shared home with someone who doesn't remain a stranger, and who is also interested in swapping ideas, meals, music, and stories with their flatmate.\n\nThe place is a jewel: the entire top flat of an older Edwardian (1910), with wood floors and many old-school touches. The flat is mostly furnished. There's a roomy back yard, built-in cabinets with leaded glass, big kitchen, lots of windows, washer/dryer, storage in the garage. It'll be just the two of us here, despite the remarkable size of the place, and our spaces are on opposite ends of the flat, so very private.\n\nThe available bedroom faces the yard, is very quiet, and gets morning sun. It's got a rug and a queen bed with mattress. It can also have a lamp, some shelving, a chest of drawers, a table/desk with office chair, etc., or you can supply those things for yourself if you'd like, your choice.\n\nIt's hard to beat the Inner Richmond as a 'hood. A block from GG Park, plentiful transit, a nearby Safeway, and the Asian enclave of Clement street (which hosts a terrific Sunday farmer's market).\n\nThere's a small, unheated room that I'm open to making into a space that both my roommate and I can share. A crafting space? Yoga/meditation? Music room? Reading study? I'm not an artist, so don't want to make an art studio out of it, but am open to lots of ideas.\n\nOther tidbits:\n- While I'm not the most organized soul and my furniture ain't fancy, I like to keep things clean. I'm looking for a roomie who also appreciates clean and strives for minimal clutter (even if you don't always achieve it).\n- I'm a vegetarian and an avid cook. I don't care if you eat meat but I'm looking for someone who will not be cooking meat in the house. There's a whole lotta gluten and dairy around here, tho, if that matters to you.\n- No smoking, no drugs (including 420).\n- There is no TV in the house, and I prefer not to have one in our shared space. The room for rent does have a cable hookup.\n- Street parking only. I'm a bike commuter. Plenty of room for bikes in the garage. Zipcar, Enterprise CarShare, and Getaround cars are nearby\n- No cats or dogs, sorry.\n\nRent: $1200/month\nDeposit: Last month rent + $1000.\nMove-in: Aug 1\nUtils: Vary $50 - 150/month, including wireless, phone, PG&E, garbage.\n\nAbout me: I'm female, a self-employed science journalist, educator, and multi-purpose nerd. I'm old enough to have outgrown my rock n' roll party days, but am still spirited. I work at home several days a week. I'm very physically active: been a bike commuter for 20 years, love to walk, hike, be outdoors sweating. I'm a believer in the power of a good, home-cooked meal, and regularly hit the Clement St. farmer's market on Sunday. My home is my refuge, and I definitely need my time alone, but welcome company and conversation as well. I floss as directed, wield impeccable social skills, maintain a sunny disposition, and harbor a love of board games.\n\nIf you think you might be a good match for my sunlit home and friendly cockatiel, you can drop a line. Tell me a bit about yourself and what draws you to this posting. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you!\n\n    ", "Title": "Large, sunny room in upper flat with big kitchen, yard, laundry", "URL": "https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/roo/6194269055.html", "Compensation": null, "Updated post time": "2017-06-26  5:42pm", "Post Id": "6194269055", "Address": "inner richmond"},
