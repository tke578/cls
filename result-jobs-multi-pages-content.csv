1 Bedroom available in a shared 2 bedroom apartment next to Dolores Park starting July 1 for the month. 
 Amazing location.  I will be in Portland most of the month, so you will have the apartment to yourself most of the time. 




This is a temporary room for someone who is working full time and looking for permanent housing. 

It's a great location in the heart of the Mission Dolores neighborhood with the Muni on the same block. 

You will have the place mostly to yourself. I will use the 2nd bedroom occasionally when I have work in the city. 

It's an easy going apartment where I have hosted Airbnb guests for some time.

We have a huge room in an amazing house opening up on July 1st! We prefer a male roommate just to keep the balance of two guys and two gals.

A bit about the house: Our house is huge 4 bedroom/2bathrooms (technically three bathrooms, one is in the garage and we never really use it but if you'd like to clean it up a bit and claim it- it's yours!), three stories with a washer/dryer, two garages, spare room, spacious living room, spacious kitchen, backyard (with a brick stove), side yard, endless free street parking (street sweeping only happens two mornings a month) and mellow, quiet neighbors- there's a lot to love about this place that's for sure!

The Neighborhood: We love our location because it's far enough from the noise (you can hear crickets in our backyard), but close enough to walk to down to Irving St (right down the hill) which is filled with tons of great eateries, cafes, trains to downtown, golden gate park, some little bars, and Andronicos. But our favorite part of the neighborhood is the amazing little parks and look outs that are about a 5-10 minute walk up our hill that have great views, tennis courts and fun paths to walk.

About us: We are 3 mid-late twenties (2 girls one guy) who have lived in the house for 5 years. We're all very close friends and have been roommates for several years. Our house style is casual, clean, welcoming, worldly, and very homey :) We all went to college in SF and kind of fell in love with our house and stayed. We are all outgoing, goofy, love meeting new people, adventuring to new places and like to do spontaneous things like go play soccer at night in the park, go rock climbing, have a little bbq in the backyard, travel and meet people from all over the world.
G- from Brazil does freelance music composing and works from home, loves travling and the outdoors, is always cooking delicious brazilian and italian food in our kitchen and will sometimes give you some if you're lucky :)
V- (f), Is a yoga instructor and interested in documentary film and travel, she is always up for an adventure and sometimes will lead a yoga class in our living room!
H- (f), is busy working loong hours in film production so is never around during the week and goes to bed super early, she loves travel, dance, art, singing and being outside.

I'm subletting my corner room in a 3 unit apartment in the Haight. The room is beautiful - has two sets of bay windows. Lots of sun. You can see up to Buenavista Park and down Haight Street. The room itself is spacious, has hardwood floors, and a built in closet. 

Ample parking around Buenavista Park. The apartment is right across the street from Ritual Coffee. Tons of fun restaurants and bars on Haight Street. A quick walk to the Panhandle and Golden Gate Park. Access to the 6 and 7 MUNI lines to get downtown. 

Two other roommates (guy and a girl) in their early/mid twenties. A works in fashion. Very cool girl/punk rock vibes. Super friendly and has a great love of potstickers. B is s super polite midwestern boy. Likes to take home things he finds on the street. Cooks a lot with varied success. 

I'm leaving the apartment to move in with family across town. Looking for a July 1st move-in with possibility to move-in a few days earlier.

Come be the 4th roommate in our spacious Edwardian flat! Our roommate is moving out and we are looking to fill this spot on July 1st.

We are in a great location on Fell St. between Fillmore & Steiner, just a block away from the beauty of Alamo Square Park. The 22 and 21 busses pick up within a block or two and the N is a short walk as well; the highway is right nearby if you've got a car and are getting on the road; we're less than a 10 minute walk to all the good stuff on Divis like BiRite and the Indy, or in the other direction to all the wonderful food & shops of Hayes Valley. Basically, we are in an amazing spot!

About the house's inhabitants: The couple at the other end of the hall are a teacher and musician/manager of a venue. They are in the kitchen A LOT, cooking up a storm. They have a skittish 3-legged fluffy cat who will often explore down at your end of the hall; if you are allergic to fluffy cats this is not the place for you. The roommate you'll be sharing the front half of the apartment with is a freelance filmmaker. Age range is 25-37.  

About you: You are a MALE (sorry ladies), have NO PETS (sorry, but our kitty would freak), and are in a similar age range. You are respectful, chill, gainfully employed, and are out and about more than you are home. You are also someone who doesn't care for cooking and doesn't use the kitchen all that often (that's the way it is now and that's how we'd like it to stay). If this doesn't sound like you, you probably aren't a good fit!

About the flat: We share the third (top) floor of the house. We have a big backyard with a fire pit that we share with the two other flats in the building. Our apartment is then split into two parts separated by a long 60' hallway. Each end of the hall has 2 bedrooms and a full bath, and we share the kitchen and laundry room. A couple shares the back end of the house, and the front end you'll be on has a room opening up.

About your room: Very spacious (12' by 18'), nice big windows (facing Fell St), and a mid-sized closet with some storage shelves. You will share a mid-sized living room and a bathroom with one male roommate on your side of the house.
If you're interested please shoot us an email with a little bit about yourself--who you are & what you're all about. If you seem like a good fit we'll schedule a room showing.

Room is $1175/month plus utilities  (WiFi, PG&E, plus house shared cleaning supplies) which ranges from $75-100 a month.  Security deposit is $1175. Move in date is July 1st.

Happy house hunting!

A brand new SOMA apartment building has a 2 Bed and 2 Bathroom available. It's located in a great area, near a good mix of grocery & shopping outlets ( Nordstrom Rack, Bed Bath & Beyond, Trader Joe's). As well as restaurants and cafes (SO, Terroir & Cat Club)

Wi-Fi access in community social spaces 
Guest parking
On-site retail

Beer Gardens
Bike storage

Move in wouldn't be hard, it's flexible. The rent would be $1300 and the security deposit would be the same as one month's rent. It'll be a one year lease. We can't take pets though :(

1 bedroom available in a 3 bedroom/2 bath apartment in the Mission. Apartment contains an entry way, combined living room/kitchen, and a back yard. There is also a bike storage room in the basement. A laundromat is located directly across the street. The entire apartment is furnished except for the bedroom for rent. 

About Us:
-28 year old male UCSF PhD student.  
-31 year old landscape architect 

We are both clean, responsible, and quiet. We work pretty standard hours (~8 or 9 AM - 7 PM). We often enjoy doing communal dinners, although of course not necessary. We are looking for a roommate who is responsible, professional, and clean of any gender or sexual orientation. 

The apartment is located just a block away from 24th st, and therefore is close to restaurants, bars, and public transportation. It is roughly a 10 minute walk to 24th St Bart, and a 7 minute walk to SFGH where the Gold/Blue/Yellow shuttles pick up. 

No additional pets. We have a small, friendly, and well behaved ~4 year old shih tzu. 

Apartment is available as soon as now through the end of July. Rent is $1200 plus utilities (usually $30-40 per person per month). Rent will be prorated for the month of June.

Furnished room in a comfortable and well-located 2 bedroom apartment available July 1. 

The room is 11x12 with a good-sized closet and comes with a comfy queen bed, a small desk/end-table, coffee table, and 2 lamps. If you'd prefer unfurnished, let's talk. It may be possible. Large window faces south so it gets great light and full sun. Rent is $1350/month + $500 security deposit. 

The apartment is a 2-bedroom with a spacious living room/dining room and good sized kitchen. I've lived here for over a year and so things are pretty well stocked in terms of furniture and kitchen. Some of the perks: big woven carpet, surround sound audio, record player, hand-turned coffee grinder that makes all the hipsters jealous, skylights in kitchen and bathroom, and lots of plants. 

It's 2 blocks from Golden Gate Park, 5 blocks from Geary and the Clement Street corridor and 6 blocks from Haight-Ashbury. There's a local grocery around the corner and Trader Joe's, Safeway, and Whole Foods all nearby. There are several local coffee shops in the neighborhood and lots of food options. USF is right up the hill and UCSF is directly across the park. 

4 bus lines run downtown from here, including the 5 Fulton which runs a standard and/or Rapid service. You can get downtown (and to BART) in 15 minutes most times of day. The 33 also runs over to the Mission regularly. 

No pets allowed and no cigarette smoking inside. No couples. Sorry. 

ABOUT ME: 
I'm a 35 year-old straight male. Very chill and accommodating. I'm comfortable with all types of people. I'm a real norcal kid. I enjoy hoppy beer, strong coffee, green plants, funky music, mountains, creeks, rivers, and good people. I cook, and I'm clean but not OCD. I work for a small nonprofit working on peace and justice issues in the Middle East (yeah, it keeps me busy). I also travel regularly. 

ABOUT YOU: 
I'm looking for someone that is tidy (does dishes and vacuums every once in awhile), conscious (woke), and communicative (be a human being, please). This is a place where you can feel comfortable to be yourself. 

If it sounds good to you, send me a message. I'm hoping to meet people very soon and hopefully get this wrapped up well before the end of the month! The more you tell me about yourself, the better. 

good luck!

The apartment is in the beautiful, fun neighborhood of Hayes Valley and I'm hoping to find someone that I get along well with to share it with. The building has a gym, rooftop with views and package pickup service. This is in the Avalon Hayes Valley building. 

A little about me: I'm a 25 year old female and work down in the South Bay in marketing. I'm pretty outgoing, but respectful of others and am usually out on weeknights/weekends exploring new restaurants or hanging with friends. I also love to travel and be outdoors. Looking forward to meeting you!

I'd prefer to live with another girl, but have lived with guys before as well so I'm open to both.

Hello ladies!

Looking for a friendly gal to move into the second bedroom at our cute house in beautiful lower pac heights. I have to leave my amazing room mate, so posting this on her behalf! :( 

About the place:
We have sky light windows in the kitchen and bathroom, along with high ceilings and large windows throughout the house. 
We're on the second floor; Our living room windows look down on trees outside and the street below (sunny and quiet!).
Your bedroom has a mini, private terrace, which your window opens up to (along with the living room on the opposite side - see pics!).
Your bedroom comes with a bed and large dark wooden dresser, but we can get rid of both if you don't want them!
You'll have a private half bathroom and will share the shower (for us this has been easy).
The living room and kitchen are spacious and have lots of natural light!
We have cable, but were considering getting rid of it -- this is something that's up for discussion.
There's free laundry downstairs that we share with a few other tenants in our building. 
Bus lines are one and a half blocks away to take you straight into FiDi/downtown. And everywhere else is typically a $4 to $8 lyft line away, including the train station. (Hello, easy commute!) 
Only a block walking distance from all the charming things in Pac Heights! I.e. coffee shops, restaurants, ice cream, shopping, bookstore. Prime time location!

The ideal roomie:
Female in 20's or early 30's. (She is 28 and I'm 29)
Friendly, courteous, and easy to get along with
Clean and tidy! We always keep the common areas clean with no personal items laying around. :-D

Your roomie is an ambitious VC usually pretty busy with work/networking events, so living here will sometimes feel like you live along! But when she is around, she'll make you coffee, tell you a story, and be overall lovely company.

Hi, my name is Ann, and I am looking for a 2-3 month sublet starting July to my Nob Hill apartment to replace my roommate who is moving to the East Coast for business school. The exact term can be negotiated, but this is by no means a long-term rental.

I'm looking for a roommate that is clean AND neat (wipes down the kitchen counter after use, checks the stove for spills/splatters after cooking, cleans their hair out of the shower drain, etc.), works a normal weekday schedule, and likes dogs. 

About me:
I'm in my early thirties, and currently in between jobs. As such, I will be home a lot during the days, but I am by no means a homebody. I am gone quite often visiting my parents in San Jose or traveling while enjoying funemployment! I enjoy cooking, going out for dinner, and being outdoors as much as possible with the pup. It would be great if I can find someone who wants to go out out occasionally or have a glass of wine but is also happy to co-exist independently. 

My dog:
Your third roommate will be my 10 year old Boston Terrier, who is extremely mellow and easy going. He has free rein in the common areas (couches, kitchen, etc.), but of course your room will be off-limits. Unfortunately, there are no other pets allowed.

About the apartment:
•	Located at the top of Nob Hill, with easy access to the 1 and 27 buses, as well as Trader Joe's and Whole Foods
•	Our unit is a corner unit in the back of the building, and does not share any walls with other units
•	Large kitchen with granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and ample shelving
•	Furnished living room, I'm still rounding out some minor pieces to replace what my roommate is taking with her, though the main pieces are here (tv, couch, armchairs)
•	Small patio off the kitchen
•	Shared bathroom with marble tiling and a clawfoot tub/shower
•	Laundry in the building

Your room:
The dark blue dresser and bed shown in the pictures will be staying in the room for your use, the pictures will be packed up and the holes patched. If you have additional furniture you would like to bring with you, that can certainly be discussed. Your room is a corner unit, with windows on two sides of the room, and a beautiful view of the hillside from one. 

If this sounds like a good fit for you, please respond with a bit about yourself, including:
•	Occupation
•	Ideal cleaning routine
•	What your typical week looks like (weekday and weekend) - work, social activities
•	Hobbies
•	Contact information including cell phone #

Move-in costs will be first months' rent and $1,355 security deposit (which cannot be applied to last months' rent). Utilities flat fee of $120/month includes cleaners once a month as well as fast internet. I look forward to chatting with you.

Hi Craiglist!

I am looking for a female to fill my room in our amazing three 3 bedroom (with a living room) 1 bath apartment in Russian Hill.  I love this place and am really sad to be leaving.  The room is huge for SF standards and comes with a walk in closet.  I am looking for someone to fill the room by July 23 but am pretty flexible with move in date.  Lease goes until Oct 31 but opportunity to resign.  To move in, I would need you to pay $2550 security deposit which you will get back from me when the lease is up October 31st.  Internet and cable will come to $40, PGE $25 and water $25 per person/per month.

About the place:
2 unit building but no one has lived upstairs for the last 8 months
Hardwood floors throughout
Remodeled bathroom and kitchen!
Beautiful bay views
Laundry mat directly across the street
Garage parking for $300
Living room
Storage room
BACKYARD!!

About the roommates:
27 year old gay male (Eddie) and 27 year old female (Jenny)  are responsible, clean and both work 9-5.  Eddie recently moved up from LA and Jenny is from Michigan originally but has lived in SF for the last 2 years.  Both are respectful, don't bring the party home and enjoy a casual glass of wine during the week.  No ragers!

We have a huge room in SoMa available for rent in a luxury 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment.

Move-in cost would be first month's rent as well as the security deposit (which is equal to 1 month's worth of rent). 

This would be for a 12 month lease, and unfortunately no pets for now :(

Hello Everyone,

******Here is the current living arrangement at this point. Three SFSU students rented my place and two of them have graduated and decided to move back home. I have found a new tenant for the room with the shared bath. The Master Bedroom with private bath is still available and will rent for 1350 with all utilities covered by landlord. The room will be vacant and available on July 1, 2017. The current tenant staying is very courteous, sweet, and respectful. Her name is Jessica.

Here is the description of the layout of the house. 

A newly built 3 bedrooms 2 full baths in-law apartment for rent in the Sunset Parkside District of San Francisco. My apt in law has hardwood floors throughout and the three bedrooms are very decent size. There are two full baths (including a master bedroom with a full bath) and a nice kitchen for you as well. Public Transportation includes L Taraval Muni which is (one blocks away) and the 71, 18, and 29 bus lines are also all walking distant from our house. It's very easy and convenient to get to Downtown, SF State University and City College. This apt is perfect for three students attending SFSU. The top unit is occupied by my family. We are very respectful and quiet so we're looking for tenants that will do the same. Ideally, we'd like to rent to someone who is clean, drama free, and will pay rent on time. 

TERMS: 
Monthly Rent: $1350 for room with all utilities included with a one year lease.
Security Deposit: $1,000  
No Pets, No Smoking, No Drugs, No Parties

Please email me SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF and I will get back to you asap. Thank you so much for your time and good luck with your search.

Thank you,
Andy

For up to two people, we have a large (10'9""x 14"" w/ 11' ceiling) furnished bedroom with PRIVATE newly-remodeled bath in a one-of-a-kind modern 2 bedroom/2 bath historical Victorian beauty built in 1884! This is the lower of two flats. This modernized home is a real treat and we are looking to share it with up to two more responsible people from whatever background. The room is opening up July 4th or slightly earlier as a flexible term furnished lease, with preference given to those who agree to a one year term. 

FEATURES:
- First floor flat: rear opens to street level on Seymour Street; - Fully Furnished bedroom (wrought-iron-framed queen bed, oak night stand and two large dressers, plus other amenities -- not on the street -- quiet);
- Large walk-in closet with built-in shelves and drawers from California Closets;
- Sliding doors in back reading room to nice patio with gas grill;
- Newer 2nd bathroom with shower, fixtures, and electrical;
- Kitchen with granite counter tops, Cherrywood cupboards, modern appliances: new dishwasher, new refrigerator, gas stove, microwave, coffee maker;
- Comcast high-speed wireless or wired Internet (optional, share 1/3rd the cost);
- Protected by ADT Security, and 4K high-definition security cams;
- Electricity and natural gas (included, unless you're running lots of computer equipment and electronics constantly, then we'll talk);
- We have the place cleaned by our cleaning people every 4-7 weeks for $140ish. You'd pay one third of that. 
- Reasonable amount of storage in basement for your personal property (no room for large furniture items either in the apartment or in the basement -- remember, this is a fully furnished apartment);
- New large capacity commercial grade washer, and dryer;
- 11' ceilings in most parts of the flat except hallway;
- Central forced air heat; former coal-burning fireplace refurbished and converted to natural gas in living room; 
- DirecTV, plus large color flat panel TV in living room with hookup in your bedroom is available and optional: you pay 1/3 the DirecTV monthly bill (at this time, we don't subscribe to any premium channels). We have a large flat panel LCD TV for you to use if you need it; and 
- Dry Cleaner/Laundry literally one block away on Divisadero Street.

Parking is really pretty easy in the neighborhood, and there are NO RESIDENTIAL PARKING STICKERS NEEDED in our immediate neighborhood. We have street cleaning once a week on Fridays from 12-2 on our little side street, Seymour Street. Street parking is good in our neighborhood, with no residential parking permit currently required. 

In addition to the monthly rent, you'll pay a pro rata share of the building's water/sewer bill every month (depends on number of bodies occupying our unit, but your share of this amount is usually fairly minimal, probably around $23/mo.). Security deposit equivalent to one month's rent required; additionally, 1/2 of the last month's rent due upon signing of lease. Credit check required. 

We are a secure gay married couple, and we're looking for people cool with that. We're pretty easy going. Social drinking is cool. 420 is cool. We really would like you not to ""hole up"" in the room and never come out of it. We'd like to have a civil and friendly relationship with you. And, we encourage you to take advantage of what our flat has to offer. Have your friends over, make meals in the kitchen, have people over for dinner or whatever, and stuff like that. It's your home too! Oh, yeah. We've got two dogs: a brother and sister from the same litter, twelve years old, rescued from the Central Valley -- ""Large, medium-sized dogs,"" as we like to describe them. They're Shepherd mixes, and have never ever bitten anybody, although they are vocal when people come to the door. But they settle down soon after.... 

ABSOLUTELY NO hard drug users. We won't tolerate that. 

We're near a bunch of MUNI lines: 24 Divisadero, 5 and 5R Fulton, 31 Balboa, 38 and 38R Geary, 21 Hayes, 22 Fillmore -- all within one to seven minutes walking distance from our place. AND, we're just a few minutes' walk from the hustle and bustle of the ""happening"" Divisadero corridor of the NOPA neighborhood: with funky shops and all different kinds of bars and restaurants. And there are four different convenience stores and a Walgreens within a five minute or less walk from our place (and a Safeway about 6-7 blocks away, and a Bi-Rite and other fresh grocer close by too.)

Smokers cool, but we ask you to smoke outside on the patio, not in your room. 

To get started with the application, reply to this email, ASK FOR AN APPLICATION, and we'll email you back the Application for Rental. We can go from there, OK? Thanks! If you have a dog that we agree on, there's a $200 addition to your security deposit. Sorry, NO CATS!

Hi there!

THE PLACE: 11.5 x 12 ft. room in a 3-bedroom / 2-bath shared apartment in the Inner Sunset, available June 23th, and running through at least October 1st... The room is quiet and cozy; off-street at the back of the unit with a window overlooking the garden area and Mt. Sutro. A full bath is shared with other roommate, and there is also a large living room with a fireplace! Our unit comprises the entirety of the top floor of a three-unit building on a residential block. Back yard access, and coin-operated laundry in the garage. Parking in a driveway spot is negotiable for a compact car. Conveniently located within a 5-minute walk to Golden Gate Park, a 15-minute walk to UCSF, and half a block from the N Judah Muni line. It's pretty nice.

US: The two of us roommates are working professionals in our early 30's (a male and a female), and we both work primarily from home and travel for work occasionally. There are also two furry roommates roaming the premises: 9-year old cat brothers! One of which is the most chill, friendly, dog-like cat you've ever met. His brother on the other-hand, is slightly more of a cat... There is a young family with two young children that live downstairs. 

YOU: Working professional (male or female, doesn't matter to us) or at least adult enough to have your shit together- respectful, tidy, and not allergic to cats (because that would just suck for you). You do not work from home, because we both work from home, and I think that we would probably go completely nuts if three of us worked from home. Single occupancy is ideal. No smoking of any kind in the building, but outside is fine.

MONIES: $1000 refundable security deposit and $1,500 a month, for a total of $2,500 to move-in. Utilities of gas, electric, internet, & Comcast cable end up being a total of around $30 per month per person. 

Email only please at first, we can exchange phone numbers after to set up a viewing time. Say, ""Hello, Ralph!""    ",post id: 6176559319,"Private Room in Large, Top-Floor Flat in the Inner Sunset",https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/roo/6176559319.html,inner sunset / UCSF,

A group of young easy going male students who are very focus in studying, if you are looking for a quiet place to study, this is the right place.

The room is located in the sunset area. Bus 28 is in front of the house which takes you to SFSU in less than 10 mins and the buses come frequently. 2 blocks of Muni N or Bus 71, N car will get you to downtown or to BART transfer within 20 minutes.

We are looking for similarly minded who is quite, clean, respectful MALE student in their ~20s.

Also nearby: great restaurants, grocery stores, Cafes, video stores, and public library. You will have your own bedroom, but share bathroom with other roommates.

$75 Utilities include garbage, wireless internet connection and electricity.

Washer/dryer is also available.

In order to maintain a good, clean, and quiet environment for all, no party, no drinking, no smoking, no drama, and no pets.

If you want a very quite academic environment that is conducive to success to this is the perfect place for you. If you are a social butterfly with an active social calendar this is not your best option.

About the room:
 
I'm looking to rent a room in my three­-bedroom flat starting July 1. The room is a decent size, 10.5 by just over 11 feet. It has hardwood floors and a sizable closet, about eight feet long and two feet deep. You will be sharing a bathroom with my other roommate. My flat is the first floor (above the garage) in a building with two units. It is bright and airy, with plenty of large windows to let in the sunlight or breeze. You will be paying $1,150 a month plus a third of the utilities (PG&E, recently installed Sonic Gigabit(!), and trash). There is a (free!) washer and dryer in the garage for your use. You will also have access to the backyard, where you can garden, lounge, read a book or barbecue with your friends. The flat has a large living room (with a fireplace), bar and an ample kitchen. I park my car in the garage, but there is permitted street parking if you own a car. If you ride Muni, it is two blocks from the N­-Judah, 6, 43, 44, and 66 bus lines. It is a quick walk to Golden Gate Park or 9th and Irving, which is abundant in shops, restaurants and bars. It is also walking distance to the UCSF Parnassus Medical Center. This is a clean, quiet and safe neighborhood.
 
About us:
 
I'm a guy in my early-30s. I'm laid back, like to keep busy, and occasionally have my friends over. When I'm home, I spend most of my time in the living room reading, on my laptop, playing games, or watching TV. I love cooking and eating, and sometimes throw dinner/theme parties with my friends (you would always be welcome to join). I have a fully­-stocked bar (I consider myself an amateur bartender) and pretty much always have beer in the fridge. I'm VERY clean (hopefully you are too)! Most of all, I am just living life and enjoying our beautiful city. In the other room is my late­-20s roommate. He is fun, energetic and very easy-­going. He enjoys cooking dinner, fine bottles of beer, working out, and outdoorsy stuff. We both work hard and like to come home to our awesome apartment to unwind, or maybe go out in the neighborhood (can you say Warriors game?).
 
 
About you:
 
Ideally I'm looking for a late­-20s to early­-30s working professional or student. The landlord highly prefers a UCSF affiliate, although it is not a requirement (I still work in the field and enjoy a lot of healthcare/biotech/pharma shop talk at home). It would be great if you are generally quiet, but talkative; social, but not a party animal. Please don't be a shut­-in. We don't need to become best friends, but hopefully you are open and friendly. I prefer a non smoker and a social drinker (please don't bring the party home with you). Sorry, no pets. And please, no live­-in significant others. I'm not looking for unicorns here (although quirky and interesting is a plus), pretty much just be a decent human being. If you are interested, send an e­-mail with some information about yourself (age, job, brief bio, what you do for fun, favorite color, etc.) and I'll e­-mail back to set­up a viewing if I think you're a good fit.

Hello my fellow working professionals, so I have an apartment with 2 Beds and 2 Bathrooms in a recently opened building, so I'm looking to fill an empty spot and hopefully you can be that person. The apartment has various features available to residents.

Apartment Features: 
Keyless entry front doors
Upgraded GE stainless steel appliances, including gas ranges
Hardwood-style plank flooring
Upgraded Moen plumbing fixtures
USB charging outlets

Community Features:
Rooftop deck 
Wi-Fi access in community social spaces
State-of-the-art fitness center with TRX training equipment
Pet park
Guest parking
Beer gardens
Bike storage

 It's near BART, Caltrain, and varies rental cars like Zipcar or Enterprise for the commuter or just to explore the city. So moving in would be pretty flexible, it'll be a one year lease. The rent is $1300 and the deposit would be the same as a month's rent. We can't take pets unfortunately.

We've got a room open in a three bedroom / one bath apartment for rent. The apartment is across the street from Baker Beach. Rent is $1000.00/month + Utilities.

The two of us are buddy's from college who are in their late twenties. Both of us are easy to get along with and don't really take issue with much. We work day jobs during the M-F, so we're pretty laid back on weekdays. But we also like to have a good time on the weekends. 

We are looking for someone who is down for having a beer now and then, versus someone who will move in and act like a total stranger. The two of us are pretty clean, although there can be a mess every once. We're also pretty active on weekends (surfing, hiking, etc.). Apartment is 420 friendly. 

The lease is up for renewal in February of 2018, so we are looking for someone who at a minimum will be there until then. If interested reach out to me and we'll get something scheduled.

We have an opening in our 5BR house and are looking for an awesome person to move in! Rent is $1600, and includes utilities, cable, internet, and bi-monthly cleaning service.

The Neighborhood:
We think it's the best location in The City. It is located on a safe quiet block in Duboce Triangle, which is in between the Mission, Castro and Lower Haight; all which are walkable from the apartment. The neighborhood has everything you need within walking distance. Whole Foods, Safeway, bars, restaurants, cafes, theaters, and Duboce/Dolores Park, you name it and we probably walk there. Close to the Church/Castro Muni Stations, the 16th Street BART Station, and 22, 24, 35 and 37 bus lines, it's the perfect location to get anywhere in The City.

The House:
Our apartment is the top two floors of a 4 story Victorian house. The apartment has 5 bedrooms, 2 baths, a full modern kitchen (including a dishwasher), a laundry room, an upstairs living room, an open back patio, grill, gas fireplace, and a backyard.

Us: We're a group of four 20-somethings -- two straight guys, two gay guys -- looking to fill the void in our house with someone awesome.  We all have our own personal lives outside the house but do hang out frequently and are pretty close.  We keep it pretty low key on the weeknights, usually consisting of a combination of happy hours, exercising, cooking dinner, television, and sharing a bottle of wine/a few beers. On the weekends we do enjoy having friends over and do throw the occasionally BBQ/party. To our knowledge... we're really accommodating (whether you want to throw a party or turn it down) and experienced living with other people. 

You:
We're looking for someone who will mesh well in the house and in a similar place in their life. We want someone whom we can go have drinks with, chill at the park with, etc. but also has their own personal life. Someone who is respectful of the shared spaces and cleans up after themselves.

If you are interested in the room and think you would be a great fit for the house, tell us why you want to live with us. Please include a link to your FB so we know you are a real person. We will be looking over emails the next few days and will let you know if we want to meet you in person.

Move in date would be July 15th, but we can be a little flexible as we want to find the right roommate.    ",post id: 6175861555,Duboce Triangle BR Open in Awesome House,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/roo/6175861555.html,castro / upper market,

Hi,

My roommate just bought a house so I am renting out his room in our 2BR/2BA apartment right by Polk street. It will be available on July 1st. 

It is a fun location, with easy access to Whole Foods and a bunch of bars on Polk street. The apartment itself has a lot of natural light, and it comes with a parking space, and a washer/dryer in the unit. It is the master bedroom in the apartment, and comes with its own en-suite bathroom. The apartment has a large living room, which gets a lot of sun, and there is an attached balcony. 

The building has 24-hour security, a gym, hot tub, sauna, and pool (all included in the price). 

About me:
I'm a 25 year old guy working in finance. I am quiet on weekdays and am rarely home. On weekends, I will sometimes have friends over but I am often out of the house. I'm clean, quiet, and don't make a mess cooking (because I don't cook). I don't have pets. 

Please reach out with any questions or if you would like to see the place.    ",post id: 6175861771,Master bedroom in Nob Hill (with private bathroom),https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/roo/6175861771.html,lower nob hill,

 It's near BART, Caltrain, and varies rental cars like Zipcar or Enterprise for the commuter or just to explore the city. So moving in would be pretty flexible, it'll be a one year lease. The rent is $1300 and the deposit would be the same as a month's rent. We can't take pets unfortunately.

We're two guys and a girl and a dog who work in the city (the dog stays at home). Looking for someone who is a working professional, working unprofessional, struggling to make it or still figuring it out - as long as you are mature, dependable and can pay the rent. The room has been unfilled for a while, so I promise I'll try to move quickly on this if you reply.

The apartment is the top floor of a building with three apartments. We're friends with the downstairs neighbours, share the backyard with them and have a good little community going on. We're looking for someone who wants to hang out occasionally, can clean up after themselves but is otherwise not too fussy, and will be here for the long term.

Tell us a bit about yourself and what you're looking for, and link to your online profiles!
